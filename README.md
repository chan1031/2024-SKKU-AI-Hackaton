# 0. Introduce
Our service generates braille substitute materials for visually impaired students, providing an alternative to traditional textbooks. When a teacherâ€™s lecture is received as an MP3 audio file, it is converted into text using AWS Lambda and a transcription service. The text is then refined through OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API to create a summarized version, which is transformed into braille format. For images, OpenCV is utilized to convert them into braille. Additionally, a TTS service is available for image descriptions: scanning a QR code initiates a generative AI analysis of the image, which is read aloud through AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
